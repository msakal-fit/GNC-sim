## Windows Installation

### Prerequisites

Before starting the installation, ensure you have the following:
- **MATLAB** installed on your Windows system
- Administrative rights on your Windows machine

### Installation Steps

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

1. Choose a folder, preferably the Documents folder
2. Open command prompt normally (without admin rights)
3. Navigate into the chosen folder and clone the GitHub repository:
   ```
   cd Documents
   git clone https://github.com/Autonomy-Lab-FIT/GNC-sim.git
   ```

**Note:** If you don't have git installed, download it from the Git website first. When you run the clone command, it may ask for your login credentials (for private repositories).

#### Step 2: Install Docker Desktop

1. Download Docker Desktop exe file from the official Docker website
   ```
   https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
   ```
2. Most of the windows based systems are based on AMD64 architecture, so from the above website download the exe file for AMD64. You can also verify your architecture in command prompt using the below command. If your architecture is ARM64 then download the exe file for ARM64 architecture
   ```
   echo %PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE%
   ```   
3. Run the exe file as administrator
4. Continue installation with the default settings

#### Step 3: Install Ubuntu 24 from Microsoft Store

Since Docker is built on Linux, we need to emulate a Linux environment on Windows using WSL2:

1. Open Microsoft Store
2. Search and install **Ubuntu 24**
3. Restart the computer if needed

#### Step 4: Set Up Ubuntu Terminal

1. Once the installation is completed, go to the cmd (opened normally without admin rights)
2. On the top, you will find a dropdown button
3. Select **Ubuntu 24** from the dropdown list
4. Ubuntu 24 terminal will open
5. Set a username and password of your choice (ensure your username has no spaces)

#### Step 5: Configure Docker Desktop with WSL Integration

1. Once you set up the ubuntu terminal with your username and password.
2. Open Docker Desktop application
3. You can skip the sign-in process if prompted
4. Click on the gear icon (Settings) located on the top right
5. Click on **Resources**
6. Select **WSL Integration**
7. Enable the button next to Ubuntu 24 (it should turn blue from gray)
8. Click **Apply & Restart** to apply the settings in the docker application



#### Step 6: Test Display Settings

1. In the Ubuntu terminal, install x11 apps (applications with UI):
   ```bash
   sudo apt install x11-apps
   ```

2. After installation, test the display forwarding:
   ```bash
   xclock
   ```

A clock UI should appear. This confirms that WSL is able to forward the UI between Ubuntu and Windows.

#### Step 7: Pull Docker Image

In the same ubuntu terminal, Pull the Docker image from Docker Hub by running the following code:
```bash
docker pull prenithreddy/gnc_simulator:latest
```

**Note:** This will take time to download the image from Docker Hub.

#### Step 8: Navigate to Project Folder

Navigate to the folder where you cloned the GitHub repository:
```bash
cd /mnt/c/users/your_username/Documents/GNC-sim/
```

**Replace `your_username` with your actual Windows username.**

#### Step 9: Create and Run Docker Container

Create a persistent container from the pulled image by running the following command in the ubuntu terminal:
```bash
docker run -it \
 --name gnc_simulator \
 --privileged \
 -p 8766:8766 \
 -p 8888:8888 \
 --env="DISPLAY=:0" \
 --volume="/tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw" \
 --volume="$PWD:/root/sim_ws/GNC_algorithms" \
 prenithreddy/gnc_simulator:latest
```

#### Step 10: Navigate to Simulator Folder

Check if you are in the following folder:
```bash
~/sim_ws/GNC_algorithms
```

If you aren't in this folder, navigate to it:
```bash
cd /root/sim_ws/GNC_algorithms
```

#### Step 11: Start the Simulator

Run the following command to start the simulator:
```bash
./start_px4_gz_sim.sh
```

If the above command throws any errors, run these commands to fix line ending issues:
```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install dos2unix
dos2unix start_px4_gz_sim.sh
dos2unix kill_px4_processes.sh
```

Once the above step is finished, rerun the simulator start command:
```bash
./start_px4_gz_sim.sh
```

Select the drone model and the world file as per your choice.

#### Step 12: Open MATLAB

1. In cmd, open a new command prompt terminal from the dropdown menu
2. In the command prompt terminal, navigate to the MATLAB folder:
   ```bash
   cd /mnt/c/users/your_username/Documents/GNC-sim/MATLAB
   ```
   **Replace `your_username` with your actual Windows username.**

3. Open MATLAB from the command prompt terminal using the following command (this method will add all the MATLAB files to the folder path automatically):
   ```bash
   matlab
   ```

## Linux Installation

### Prerequisites

Before starting the installation, ensure you have the following:
- **MATLAB** installed on your Linux system
- **Docker** installed on your Linux system
- Terminal access with sudo privileges

### Installation Steps

#### Step 1: Install Docker (if not already installed)

##### Uninstall Old Versions

Before installing Docker Engine, uninstall any conflicting packages:

```bash
for pkg in docker.io docker-doc docker-compose docker-compose-v2 podman-docker containerd runc; do sudo apt-get remove $pkg; done
```

##### Set up Docker's apt Repository

1. Add Docker's official GPG key:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
   sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
   sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
   sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
   ```

2. Add the repository to Apt sources:
   ```bash
   echo \
     "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
     $(. /etc/os-release && echo "${UBUNTU_CODENAME:-$VERSION_CODENAME}") stable" | \
     sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

##### Install Docker Engine

Install the latest version of Docker Engine, containerd, and Docker Compose:

```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

##### Verify Installation

Verify that the Docker Engine installation is successful by running the hello-world image:

```bash
sudo docker run hello-world
```

##### Post-Installation Steps

Add your user to the docker group to run Docker commands without sudo:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Log out and log back in for the group changes to take effect, or run:

```bash
newgrp docker
```

Verify you can run docker commands without sudo:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

#### Step 2: Clone the Repository

1. Open a terminal
2. Navigate to your preferred directory (e.g., Documents or home):
   ```bash
   cd ~/Documents
   ```

3. Clone the GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Autonomy-Lab-FIT/GNC-sim.git
   ```

**Note:** If you don't have git installed, install it first using `sudo apt-get install git`. For private repositories, you may need to provide login credentials.

#### Step 3: Set Up X11 Display

1. Install X11 utilities if not already installed:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install x11-apps
   ```

2. Allow X server connections:
   ```bash
   xhost +local:docker
   ```

3. Test the display:
   ```bash
   xclock
   ```

A clock UI should appear, confirming X11 is working properly.

#### Step 4: Pull Docker Image

Pull the Docker image from Docker Hub:
```bash
docker pull prenithreddy/gnc_simulator:latest
```

**Note:** This will take time to download the image from Docker Hub.

#### Step 5: Navigate to Project Folder

Navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository:
```bash
cd ~/Documents/GNC-sim/
```

Adjust the path if you cloned it to a different location.

#### Step 6: Create and Run Docker Container

Create a persistent container from the pulled image:
```bash
docker run -it \
  --name gnc_simulator \
  --privileged \
  --env="DISPLAY=$DISPLAY" \
  --volume="/tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw" \
  --volume="$PWD:/root/sim_ws/GNC_algorithms" \
  --network=host \
  prenithreddy/gnc_simulator:latest
```

#### Step 7: Navigate to Simulator Folder

Check if you are in the following folder:
```bash
~/sim_ws/GNC_algorithms
```

If you aren't in this folder, navigate to it:
```bash
cd /root/sim_ws/GNC_algorithms
```

#### Step 8: Start the Simulator

Run the following command to start the simulator:
```bash
./start_px4_gz_sim.sh
```

If the script has permission issues, make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x start_px4_gz_sim.sh
chmod +x kill_px4_processes.sh
```

Then rerun:
```bash
./start_px4_gz_sim.sh
```

Select the drone model and the world file as per your choice.

#### Step 9: Open MATLAB

1. Open a new terminal window
2. Navigate to the MATLAB folder in your cloned repository:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Documents/GNC-sim/MATLAB
   ```
   Adjust the path if you cloned it to a different location.

3. Open MATLAB from the terminal:
   ```bash
   matlab
   ```

This method will automatically add all the MATLAB files to the folder path.

## Container Management Commands

### Post Installation
After the initial setup (or after closing the command prompt), use these commands to run the simulation:

#### Step 1: Open Ubuntu terminal
To open the ubuntu terminal, open the command prompt and then select ubuntu from the dropdown menu

#### Step 2: Start the Container Again
```bash
docker start gnc_simulator
```

#### Step 3: Attach to the Running Container
```bash
docker attach gnc_simulator
```

#### Stop the Container (if needed)

**Use the following commands only when you need to stop and remove the docker container**

```bash
docker stop gnc_simulator
docker rm gnc_simulator
```

**Note: When you close the command prompt the docker container will automatically be stopped, so you dont have to run the above command every single time**


#### Check Container Status
```bash
docker ps -a
```

#### Check Container Size
```bash
docker ps -s
```

## Troubleshooting

### Windows-Specific Issues

- If you encounter display issues, ensure X11 forwarding is working by testing with `xclock`
- If Docker commands fail, make sure Docker Desktop is running and WSL integration is properly configured
- For line ending errors in shell scripts, use `dos2unix` command as shown in Step 11
- Ensure your Windows username path is correct when navigating to mounted directories

### Linux-Specific Issues

- If X11 forwarding fails, run `xhost +local:docker` before starting the container
- If you get permission denied errors with Docker, ensure you've added your user to the docker group and logged out/in
- If display is not forwarding properly, check that `$DISPLAY` environment variable is set correctly by running `echo $DISPLAY`
- For GPU-related issues, you may need to install nvidia-docker2 for NVIDIA GPU support
- If scripts won't execute, ensure they have executable permissions using `chmod +x script_name.sh`

### General Issues

- If the simulator doesn't start, check that all dependencies are properly installed inside the container
- For memory or performance issues, check container resource usage with `docker stats gnc_simulator`
- Ensure you have sufficient disk space for Docker images and containers
